To run the consumer, make sure the system has python installed and access to AWS credentials and then run

```bash
python consumer.py --help
```

This will show the list of available arguments as well as their defaults. Keep in mind that at least one of -dwt or -wb must be specified for the consumer to know where to store created widgets.
